# Cardiotocographic Data Analysis
This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a cardiotocographic dataset, which is used to monitor fetal health during pregnancy.
## 📂 Project Structure
- `Cardiotocographic.xls` - The dataset containing fetal health data.
- `EDA1.ipynb` - A Jupyter notebook performing data cleaning, visualization, and statistical exploration.
## 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of cardiotocograms (CTG) classified by expert obstetricians into 3 categories:
- Normal
- Suspect
- Pathological
It includes 21 features derived from fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction (UC) signals.
## 🧪 Exploratory Data Analysis Highlights
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Statistical summaries of features.
- Correlation heatmaps.
- Distribution plots and outlier detection.
- Initial insights into class imbalance and feature significance.
## 📌 Objectives
- Understand the structure and patterns in the dataset.
- Identify important features that differentiate between fetal health states.
- Lay the groundwork for future classification or prediction models.
## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
